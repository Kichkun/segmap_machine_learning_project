We implemented the "Segmap" work.  SegMap is the state-of-the-art work, provided the approach of a map representation solution to the localization and mapping problem based on the extracted segments from 3D point clouds. We leverages a data-driven descriptorin order to extract meaningful features that can also be used for reconstructing a dense 3D map of the environment and for extracting semantic information. This is particularly interesting for navigation tasks and for providing visual feedback to end-users such as robot operators, for example in search and rescuescenarios.
